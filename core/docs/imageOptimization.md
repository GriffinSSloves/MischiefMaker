# Image Optimization for DCT Steganography

## Overview

This document summarizes the analysis and potential improvements made to address visual quality issues in DCT coefficient steganography. The investigation revealed significant differences in how various image types respond to steganographic modifications, leading to a proposed algorithm with perceptual weighting and adaptive quality control.

## Current status

With the proposed algorithm, the grainy issues seemed to be solved. Now there is a saturation issue, where everything appears like it has a grey filter over the image. This is happening for all images except the black shoe image.

Ignore file size changes

## Problem Analysis

### Initial Visual Quality Issues

During testing, we observed significant differences in visual quality after steganographic embedding:

**High Visual Artifacts (Poor Results):**

- **Selfie.jpg**: Portrait with skin tones, showed noticeable graininess
- **Engagement.jpeg**: Portrait photo, significant visual degradation
- **General characteristics**: Photos with faces, smooth gradients, skin tones

**Good Visual Quality (Acceptable Results):**

- **Stairs.JPG**: Architectural image with natural textures
- **BlackShoe.jpeg**: High contrast subject with natural noise
- **GoatArt.jpeg**: Artistic image with varied textures
- **General characteristics**: Structured content, natural textures, high contrast

### Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. **Quantization Mismatch**

```typescript
// PROBLEM: Re-encoding with different quantization characteristics
const encoder = new JPEGEncoder(85); // Fixed quality regardless of original
```

**Impact**: Modified DCT coefficients don't align with new quantization tables, causing compression artifacts.

#### 2. **Crude Coefficient Selection**

```typescript
// PROBLEM: Simple magnitude-based filtering
if (coef !== 0 && Math.abs(coef) >= 2) {
  // Modify coefficient
}
```

**Impact**: No consideration of perceptual importance or frequency domain characteristics.

#### 3. **Image Type Sensitivity**

- **Smooth regions** (faces, skin): Mid-frequency modifications highly visible
- **Textured regions** (natural noise): Modifications masked by existing variation
- **High contrast edges**: More tolerant of coefficient changes

#### 4. **Quality Setting Mismatch**

- **Over-compression** of high-quality originals (engagement photos at 95% ï¿½ 85%)
- **File size bloat** from quality mismatches
- **Compression artifact amplification** in already-compressed images

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Perceptual DCT Coefficient Weighting

**Problem**: All AC coefficients treated equally regardless of visual importance.

**Solution**: Frequency-domain perceptual weighting matrix.

```typescript
/**
 * Perceptual weighting matrix for DCT coefficients (8x8 block)
 * Higher values = less visually important = better for steganography
 */
const PERCEPTUAL_WEIGHT_MATRIX = [
  0, // DC component (never modified)
  5,
  8,
  12,
  16,
  20,
  24,
  28,
  32, // Low frequencies (more visible but usable)
  10,
  15,
  20,
  25,
  30,
  35,
  40,
  45, // Mid frequencies
  20,
  25,
  30,
  35,
  40,
  45,
  50,
  55, // Higher frequencies (less visible)
  25,
  30,
  35,
  40,
  45,
  50,
  55,
  60, // High frequencies (good for steganography)
  // ... continues with balanced weights
];
```

**Benefits**:

- Prioritizes high-frequency coefficients (less visible to human eye)
- Maintains practical embedding capacity
- Reduces artifacts in smooth regions (faces, gradients)

### 2. Advanced Coefficient Evaluation

**Problem**: Binary suitable/not-suitable decision based only on magnitude.

**Solution**: Multi-factor evaluation considering:

```typescript
function evaluateCoefficient(coefficient: number, coefficientIndex: number, quantizationValue: number) {
  // 1. Magnitude threshold (avoid coefficients that become zero)
  const minMagnitude = Math.max(2, Math.ceil(quantizationValue * 0.5));

  // 2. Perceptual weight (prefer high-frequency, less visible coefficients)
  const perceptualWeight = PERCEPTUAL_WEIGHT_MATRIX[coefficientIndex];

  // 3. Quantization boundary distance (avoid visible artifacts)
  const quantizationBoundaryDistance = Math.abs(coefficient) % quantizationValue;
  const nearBoundary = quantizationBoundaryDistance <= 1 || quantizationBoundaryDistance >= quantizationValue - 1;

  // 4. Final suitability weight
  const magnitudeWeight = Math.min(Math.abs(coefficient) / 10, 5);
  const finalWeight = perceptualWeight * magnitudeWeight;

  return { suitable: finalWeight >= 5, weight: finalWeight };
}
```

### 3. Image Quality Analysis & Adaptive Encoding

**Problem**: Fixed quality (85) regardless of original image characteristics.

**Solution**: Automatic quality analysis and optimization.

```typescript
interface IQualityAnalysis {
  estimatedQuality: number; // 1-100, estimated original quality
  recommendedQuality: number; // Optimal re-encoding quality
  isHighQuality: boolean; // Minimal compression artifacts?
  hasFineDetails: boolean; // Needs detail preservation?
  confidence: number; // Analysis reliability (0-1)
}

function analyzeImageQuality(decoder: IJpegInternalDecoder): IQualityAnalysis {
  // Analyze quantization tables
  const avgQuantY = quantTable.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0) / 64;
  const maxQuantY = Math.max(...quantTable);

  // Estimate original quality by comparing to standard tables
  const qualityEstimate = 100 - ((avgQuantY - 1) / (maxQuantValues - 1)) * 50;

  // Analyze high-frequency activity
  let highFrequencyActivity = 0;
  // ... measure DCT coefficient activity in high frequencies

  // Determine characteristics
  const isHighQuality = qualityEstimate > 70 && maxQuantY < 50;
  const hasFineDetails = highFrequencyActivity > 10;

  return { estimatedQuality, recommendedQuality, isHighQuality, hasFineDetails, confidence };
}
```

### 4. Quality-Specific Encoding Strategies

Based on image analysis, different strategies are applied:

#### **Detail-Preserving Strategy**

- **When**: High-quality images with fine details
- **Approach**: Use quality = max(original + 5, 90)
- **Example**: Professional photos, high-resolution images

#### **Size-Optimized Strategy**

- **When**: Target file size constraints
- **Approach**: Adjust quality to meet size requirements
- **Example**: Messaging service compatibility

#### **Artifact-Minimizing Strategy**

- **When**: Already heavily compressed images
- **Approach**: Use quality = max(original - 5, 25)
- **Example**: Web-optimized images, low-quality sources

#### **Adaptive Strategy** (Default)

- **When**: General use cases
- **Approach**: Balanced quality preservation with modest optimization
- **Example**: Most user uploads

### 5. Quantization Table Preservation

**Problem**: Re-encoding with default quantization tables loses original characteristics.

**Solution**: Extract and adapt original quantization tables.

```typescript
function adaptQuantizationTables(originalQuantTable: number[], targetQuality: number): number[] {
  // Quality factor scaling (similar to JPEG standard)
  let scaleFactor: number;
  if (targetQuality >= 50) {
    scaleFactor = (100 - targetQuality) / 50;
  } else {
    scaleFactor = 50 / targetQuality;
  }

  // Apply scaling with bounds checking
  return originalQuantTable.map(val => {
    const scaled = Math.round(val * scaleFactor);
    return Math.max(1, Math.min(255, scaled)); // JPEG quantization range
  });
}
```

## Image Type Analysis

### Why Some Images Work Better Than Others

#### **Good Steganographic Targets:**

1. **Natural Textures** (Stairs.JPG, GoatArt.jpeg)
   - **Characteristics**: Irregular patterns, varied frequency content
   - **Why good**: Modifications masked by existing texture variation
   - **DCT profile**: Rich high-frequency content provides hiding opportunities

2. **High Contrast Subjects** (BlackShoe.jpeg)
   - **Characteristics**: Sharp edges, distinct regions
   - **Why good**: Strong edges tolerate coefficient modifications
   - **DCT profile**: Concentrated energy in specific frequency bands

3. **Complex Scenes** (Architectural, artistic images)
   - **Characteristics**: Multiple objects, varied lighting
   - **Why good**: Visual complexity provides natural masking
   - **DCT profile**: Distributed energy across frequency spectrum

#### **Challenging Steganographic Targets:**

1. **Portrait Photos** (Selfie.jpg, Engagement.jpeg)
   - **Characteristics**: Smooth skin tones, subtle gradients
   - **Why challenging**: Human visual system highly sensitive to face artifacts
   - **DCT profile**: Energy concentrated in low-mid frequencies (most visible)

2. **Smooth Gradients** (Sky, water, backgrounds)
   - **Characteristics**: Gradual color transitions
   - **Why challenging**: Any noise immediately visible in smooth regions
   - **DCT profile**: Low-frequency dominance with little high-frequency content

3. **Minimal Texture** (Studio photography, clean graphics)
   - **Characteristics**: Uniform regions, minimal noise
   - **Why challenging**: No natural variation to mask modifications
   - **DCT profile**: Sparse coefficient distribution

### Frequency Domain Considerations

#### **DCT Coefficient Visibility Hierarchy:**

1. **DC Component (Index 0)**: Never modified - controls overall brightness
2. **Low Frequencies (1-15)**: Highly visible - basic image structure
3. **Mid Frequencies (16-31)**: Moderately visible - detail definition
4. **High Frequencies (32-63)**: Less visible - fine details and noise

#### **Optimal Modification Strategy:**

```typescript
// Priority order for coefficient modification:
1. High-frequency coefficients (indices 40-63) - best for steganography
2. Mid-high frequencies (indices 25-39) - acceptable with care
3. Mid frequencies (indices 15-24) - use only if high perceptual weight
4. Low frequencies (indices 1-14) - avoid unless absolutely necessary
5. DC component (index 0) - never modify
```
