# AI Collaboration Guidelines for MischiefMaker

These guidelines help AI assistants provide high-quality, consistent responses when working on the MischiefMaker project.

## Core Principles

### 1. Documentation Consistency First

**ALWAYS validate documentation consistency across ALL files after any changes:**

- Update `docs/completed.md` when tasks are finished
- Move completed items from `docs/todos.md` to `docs/completed.md`
- Update `docs/architecture.md` with architectural changes
- Ensure version numbers match between package.json and documentation
- Cross-reference all related documentation files for accuracy

### 2. Modern Best Practices Only

- Use latest stable versions and modern APIs (React Router v7 createBrowserRouter, ESLint flat config)
- Prefer new patterns over legacy ones, even if both work
- Document major technical decisions in `docs/decisions.md`
- Always check package.json versions match documentation

### 3. Code Organization Excellence

- Follow separation of concerns (dedicated modules, shared utilities)
- Apply DRY principle - create shared utilities for duplication
- Use specific, descriptive naming (`renderWithRouter.tsx` vs `test-utils.tsx`)
- Maintain co-located tests and feature-based organization

### 4. Parallel Processing Excellence

- **Use parallel tool calls whenever possible** - read multiple files simultaneously, update related documentation together
- Only use sequential operations when output of one is required for input of next
- This can make responses 3-5x faster

## MischiefMaker Coding Standards

### 5. Interface Naming Convention

**All interfaces must start with `I`:**

- `IImageProcessor`, `ISteganographyEngine`, `ICapacityCalculator`
- This clearly distinguishes interfaces from classes and types
- Apply consistently across all new interfaces

### 6. Import Conventions

**Use direct imports from source files:**

- ✅ `import { PixelData } from '../types/DataTypes';`
- ❌ `import { PixelData } from '../types';` (avoid internal index.ts)

**Exception**: Main package `src/index.ts` is the public API entry point and required

**Benefits**: Clearer code, explicit dependencies, easier refactoring

### 7. Separation of Concerns

**Keep complexity internal to engines:**

- Users shouldn't choose encoding methods manually
- Engines handle automatic method selection/detection
- Results can show what happened, but users don't need to decide

## Algorithm and Technical Decision Standards

### 8. Documentation Level Separation

**Maintain clear separation between high-level and detailed documentation:**

- **High-level files**: Strategy, configuration, pseudocode overview, trade-off summaries
- **Detailed technical files**: Complete implementation, calculations, platform specifics, alternatives

This keeps strategic documents focused and implementation details accessible.

### 9. Combination Strategy Preference

**When designing algorithms, consider combination approaches:**

- Try optimal method first, automatic fallback to reliable alternatives
- Method detection for proper handling, no user intervention required
- Often provides better real-world performance than single-method approaches

### 10. Simultaneous Documentation Updates

**When making significant algorithm decisions, update related documentation files simultaneously:**

- High-level algorithm documentation, detailed technical implementation, decision records
- This ensures consistency and prevents documentation drift

## Testing Standards

### 11. Modern Testing Patterns

- Create tests for any utilities you build
- Ensure consistent testing patterns across similar components
- Update web/README.md with testing utility usage examples

### 12. Quality Gates

- Run tests after changes to ensure nothing breaks
- Follow zero-warning ESLint policy - fix all warnings
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage for new features
- Think about maintainability and future extensibility

### 13. AI-Friendly Testing Commands

**ALWAYS use `pnpm run test:run` for AI helpers, never `pnpm test`:**

- `pnpm run test:run` - Non-interactive mode, runs once and exits cleanly
- `pnpm test` - Interactive watch mode, hangs waiting for input (bad for AI)

**Benefits of `test:run` for AI helpers:**

- ✅ Provides clear, structured test output
- ✅ Returns proper exit codes (0 = success, 1 = failure)
- ✅ No hanging or waiting for user input
- ✅ Consistent, predictable behavior
- ✅ Can target specific test files: `pnpm run test:run path/to/test.ts`

## Communication Style

### 14. Educational Explanations

- Explain the "why" before the "how"
- Provide context and reasoning for technical decisions
- Show before/after comparisons for improvements
- Discuss trade-offs and alternatives when relevant

### 15. Incremental & Validated Approach

- Build complex features step-by-step
- Use parallel tool calls for efficiency when updating multiple files
- Test frequently and validate assumptions
- Ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### 16. MischiefMaker Context

- **Tone**: Keep it fun and playful (per ADR-005) - tool for friends, not academic
- **Architecture**: Follow monorepo structure (web/, mobile/, core/)

### 17. Workflow Standards

- **Pre-commit mindset**: Format, lint, type-check, build before considering done
- **Documentation coverage**: Every feature should be documented
- **Pattern consistency**: Check how similar things are implemented
- **Future-proof thinking**: Will this be easy to modify/extend?

## Response Structure Requirements

### 18. Effective Communication

- Plan out loud - explain what you'll do before doing it
- Use parallel tool calls when operations can be simultaneous
- Validate results and confirm tests pass
- Summarize impact and explain why changes matter

### 19. Success Criteria

Every response should aim for:

- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Documentation consistent and up-to-date
- ✅ Code follows established patterns
- ✅ Modern best practices implemented
- ✅ Changes well-explained and justified

## When in Doubt

- Default to modern patterns over legacy approaches
- Prefer explicit over implicit (clear naming, obvious intent)
- Ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- Think about the next developer who will work on this code
- **Use combination strategies** that optimize for multiple goals
- **Use parallel operations** whenever possible for efficiency

## Quick Reference Commands

- **Run tests (AI-friendly)**:
  - Web: `cd web && pnpm run test:run`
  - Core: `cd core && pnpm run test:run`
  - Specific file: `cd core && pnpm run test:run path/to/test.ts`
- **Check documentation consistency across**: README.md, docs/architecture.md, docs/decisions.md, docs/todos.md, docs/completed.md, web/README.md
- **Lint**: `cd web && pnpm run lint` or `cd core && pnpm run lint`
- **Format**: `cd web && pnpm run format` or `cd core && pnpm run format`
