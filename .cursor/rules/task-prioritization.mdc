# Task Prioritization Guide

When determining what tasks to work on next, always consult the following documentation files to understand current priorities and project context:

## Primary Task Reference
- [todos.md](mdc:docs/todos.md) - Contains the current task list and immediate priorities
- [completed.md](mdc:docs/completed.md) - History of completed development tasks for context

## Context and Decision History
- [decisions.md](mdc:docs/decisions.md) - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) showing past technology choices and rationale
- [architecture.md](mdc:docs/architecture.md) - Current system architecture and planned components
- [deployment.md](mdc:docs/deployment.md) - Deployment strategy and infrastructure decisions
- [steganography.md](mdc:docs/steganography.md) - Core functionality requirements and implementation details

## Task Prioritization Rules

1. **Always check todos.md first** - This contains the most current task priorities
2. **Review completed.md for context** - Understanding what's been done helps prioritize what's next
3. **Consider architectural context** - Review decisions.md and architecture.md to ensure tasks align with established patterns
4. **Follow modern best practices** - As noted in ADR-004, always use current best practices and modern standards
5. **Maintain consistency** - Ensure new work follows the established technology stack and patterns
6. **Cross-reference documentation** - Use the docs folder to understand the full project context before making implementation decisions

## Current Project Status
- Web setup is complete with React 19, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS v4, and ShadCN UI
- Core library and mobile app are planned but not yet implemented
- Completed: React Router setup with modern createBrowserRouter architecture âœ…
- Focus should be on building the steganography functionality and user interface
