### ✅ Web Setup Evaluation and Best Practices Review
**Task**: Evaluate all web setup code and ensure we are following current best practices. Evaluate all choices of frameworks, setup files, libraries, etc and determine if there are any more up-to-date best practices.

**Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅

**Summary**: Comprehensive evaluation completed. The web setup is exemplary and follows all current 2025 best practices:

- **React 19.1.0** - Latest stable with all new features
- **TypeScript 5.8.3** - Current stable version
- **Vite 6.3.5** - Modern build tool (staying on stable 6.x)
- **TailwindCSS v4.1.10** - Latest major version
- **ESLint Flat Config** - Modern configuration format
- **ShadCN UI** - Complete component library setup
- **Comprehensive tooling** - Prettier, Vitest, accessibility rules

**Outcome**: No major changes needed. Setup is production-ready and follows industry best practices. Minor version updates available but non-critical.

**Task**: Set up folder-based test organization with co-located tests and create basic rendering tests for all components, pages, hooks, and utilities.

**Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅

- **Basic Test Coverage**: Created rendering tests for all custom components (excluding ShadCN UI components)

- **Documentation**: Updated architecture.md and web README.md with test organization strategy

**Outcome**: 
- 19 tests passing across 6 test files
- Clear separation between tested code and third-party components
- Foundation for test-driven development workflow
- All pre-commit checks passing

**Files Modified**:
- Restructured: `src/pages/`, `src/components/Layout/`, `src/hooks/use-mobile/`, `src/lib/utils/`
