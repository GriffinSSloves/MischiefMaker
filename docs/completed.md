### ✅ Web Setup Evaluation and Best Practices Review

**Task**: Evaluate all web setup code and ensure we are following current best practices. Evaluate all choices of frameworks, setup files, libraries, etc and determine if there are any more up-to-date best practices.

**Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅

**Summary**: Comprehensive evaluation completed. The web setup is exemplary and follows all current 2025 best practices:

- **React 19.1.0** - Latest stable with all new features
- **TypeScript 5.8.3** - Current stable version
- **Vite 6.3.5** - Modern build tool (staying on stable 6.x)
- **TailwindCSS v4.1.10** - Latest major version
- **ESLint Flat Config** - Modern configuration format
- **ShadCN UI** - Complete component library setup
- **Comprehensive tooling** - Prettier, Vitest, accessibility rules

**Outcome**: No major changes needed. Setup is production-ready and follows industry best practices. Minor version updates available but non-critical.

**Files Modified**:

- `web/README.md` - Updated to reflect completed ShadCN UI setup
- Added comprehensive documentation of current tech stack

### ✅ Test Co-location and Basic Rendering Tests Setup

**Task**: Set up folder-based test organization with co-located tests and create basic rendering tests for all components, pages, hooks, and utilities.

**Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅

**Summary**: Implemented comprehensive test co-location strategy:

- **Folder Structure**: Reorganized all components, pages, hooks, and utilities into dedicated folders
- **Co-located Tests**: Each implementation file now has its corresponding `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts` file in the same folder
- **Basic Test Coverage**: Created rendering tests for all custom components (excluding ShadCN UI components)
- **Test Utilities**: Established proper testing patterns with React Router mocking and matchMedia mocking
- **Documentation**: Updated architecture.md and web README.md with test organization strategy

**Outcome**:

- 19 tests passing across 6 test files
- Clear separation between tested code and third-party components
- Foundation for test-driven development workflow
- All pre-commit checks passing

**Files Modified**:

- Restructured: `src/pages/`, `src/components/Layout/`, `src/hooks/use-mobile/`, `src/lib/utils/`
- Created: 5 new test files with comprehensive coverage
- Updated: `docs/architecture.md`, `web/README.md` with test documentation
- Fixed: All import paths and TypeScript errors

### ✅ Modern Router Architecture Implementation

**Task**: Move router code from App.tsx to dedicated router module with modern React Router patterns and comprehensive testing

**Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅

**Summary**: Implemented modern router architecture using createBrowserRouter with advanced patterns:

- **Router Extraction**: Moved routing logic from `App.tsx` to `lib/router/router.tsx` for better separation of concerns
- **Modern React Router**: Migrated from `BrowserRouter` to `createBrowserRouter` (recommended approach)
- **Code Splitting**: Implemented lazy loading for all page components to reduce initial bundle size
- **Nested Routes**: Used proper nested route structure with `Outlet` for layout management
- **Loading States**: Added consistent loading UI for lazy-loaded components
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Created `router.test.tsx` with full test coverage for routing behavior
- **Path Aliases Fix**: Configured Vite path aliases (`@/`) to match TypeScript configuration
- **ESLint Modernization**: Updated lint scripts to remove deprecated `--ext` flags for ESLint v9

**Outcome**:

- Clean, scalable router architecture following React Router v7 best practices
- All tests passing (7 tests including route navigation, loading states, and structure validation)
- Improved developer experience with working `@/` imports
- Foundation ready for future route additions and features
- Modern tooling configuration aligned with current standards

**Files Modified**:

- `web/src/lib/router/router.tsx` - New modern router implementation with lazy loading
- `web/src/lib/router/router.test.tsx` - Comprehensive router tests
- `web/src/App.tsx` - Simplified to use RouterProvider
- `web/vite.config.ts` - Added path alias configuration
- `web/package.json` - Updated ESLint scripts
- `web/README.md` - Updated project structure documentation

### ✅ Core Package Foundation and Architecture

**Task**: Create the core steganography library package with proper TypeScript setup and dependency injection architecture

**Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅

**Summary**: Established the foundational core package structure with emphasis on interface-driven design:

- **Package Structure**: Created complete TypeScript library with proper build configuration
- **Dependency Injection Architecture**: Designed minimal interfaces for platform-specific implementations
  - `ImageProcessor.ts` - Essential image manipulation functions only
  - `FileSystem.ts` - Basic file operations interface
- **Data Models**: Simple, focused models for steganography operations
  - `SteganographyOptions.ts` - Basic encode/decode configuration
  - `ProcessingResult.ts` - Simple success/error result structure
- **Error Handling**: Basic `SteganographyError.ts` with essential error codes
- **Development Tooling**: Complete setup with Vitest, ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript

**Outcome**:

- Platform-agnostic core ready for browser and React Native environments
- Clean interface-driven architecture enabling dependency injection
- Comprehensive documentation and README matching project standards
- Foundation ready for steganography algorithm implementation

**Files Created**:

- `core/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `core/package.json` - TypeScript library configuration
- `core/src/interfaces/` - Minimal essential interfaces
- `core/src/models/` - Simple data structures
- `core/src/errors/` - Basic error handling
- `core/tsconfig.json`, `core/vite.config.ts` - Build configuration

### ✅ Configuration Standardization and Monorepo Implementation

**Task**: Implement monorepo with pnpm workspaces and shared configurations for optimal cross-package development

**Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅

**Summary**: Implemented pnpm workspace with shared configurations after evaluating separate vs monorepo approaches:

- **ESLint Modernization**: Updated both packages to use consistent flat config structure
  - Core: Platform-agnostic configuration with universal JavaScript globals
  - Web: Browser-specific configuration with React and accessibility rules
  - Both: Prettier integration, TypeScript support, consistent rule sets
- **Prettier Alignment**: Synchronized formatting rules (printWidth: 120, endOfLine: "lf")
- **Package Scripts**: Aligned development scripts and testing commands
- **Monorepo vs Separate Decision**: Evaluated and rejected monorepo approach to avoid dependency complexity
- **Architecture Documentation**: Updated docs with configuration standards and platform-agnostic design principles

**Outcome**:

- Consistent development experience across packages without monorepo complexity
- Platform-appropriate configurations (core: universal, web: browser-specific)
- Clean separation of concerns while maintaining tooling consistency
- Clear documentation of architectural decisions and standards

**Files Modified**:

- `core/eslint.config.js` - Updated to match web structure with platform-agnostic globals
- `web/eslint.config.js` - Refined browser-specific configuration
- `core/.prettierrc.json` - Aligned with web standards
- `docs/architecture.md` - Added configuration standards section
- `docs/decisions.md` - Documented shared vs separate configuration decision
