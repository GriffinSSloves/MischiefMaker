### ✅ Web Setup Evaluation and Best Practices Review
**Task**: Evaluate all web setup code and ensure we are following current best practices. Evaluate all choices of frameworks, setup files, libraries, etc and determine if there are any more up-to-date best practices.

**Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅

**Summary**: Comprehensive evaluation completed. The web setup is exemplary and follows all current 2025 best practices:

- **React 19.1.0** - Latest stable with all new features
- **TypeScript 5.8.3** - Current stable version
- **Vite 6.3.5** - Modern build tool (staying on stable 6.x)
- **TailwindCSS v4.1.10** - Latest major version
- **ESLint Flat Config** - Modern configuration format
- **ShadCN UI** - Complete component library setup
- **Comprehensive tooling** - Prettier, Vitest, accessibility rules

**Outcome**: No major changes needed. Setup is production-ready and follows industry best practices. Minor version updates available but non-critical.

**Files Modified**: 
- `web/README.md` - Updated to reflect completed ShadCN UI setup
- Added comprehensive documentation of current tech stack

### ✅ Test Co-location and Basic Rendering Tests Setup
**Task**: Set up folder-based test organization with co-located tests and create basic rendering tests for all components, pages, hooks, and utilities.

**Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅

**Summary**: Implemented comprehensive test co-location strategy:

- **Folder Structure**: Reorganized all components, pages, hooks, and utilities into dedicated folders
- **Co-located Tests**: Each implementation file now has its corresponding `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts` file in the same folder
- **Basic Test Coverage**: Created rendering tests for all custom components (excluding ShadCN UI components)
- **Test Utilities**: Established proper testing patterns with React Router mocking and matchMedia mocking
- **Documentation**: Updated architecture.md and web README.md with test organization strategy

**Outcome**: 
- 19 tests passing across 6 test files
- Clear separation between tested code and third-party components
- Foundation for test-driven development workflow
- All pre-commit checks passing

**Files Modified**:
- Restructured: `src/pages/`, `src/components/Layout/`, `src/hooks/use-mobile/`, `src/lib/utils/`
- Created: 5 new test files with comprehensive coverage
- Updated: `docs/architecture.md`, `web/README.md` with test documentation
- Fixed: All import paths and TypeScript errors

### ✅ Modern Router Architecture Implementation  
**Task**: Move router code from App.tsx to dedicated router module with modern React Router patterns and comprehensive testing

**Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅

**Summary**: Implemented modern router architecture using createBrowserRouter with advanced patterns:

- **Router Extraction**: Moved routing logic from `App.tsx` to `lib/router/router.tsx` for better separation of concerns
- **Modern React Router**: Migrated from `BrowserRouter` to `createBrowserRouter` (recommended approach)
- **Code Splitting**: Implemented lazy loading for all page components to reduce initial bundle size
- **Nested Routes**: Used proper nested route structure with `Outlet` for layout management
- **Loading States**: Added consistent loading UI for lazy-loaded components
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Created `router.test.tsx` with full test coverage for routing behavior
- **Path Aliases Fix**: Configured Vite path aliases (`@/`) to match TypeScript configuration
- **ESLint Modernization**: Updated lint scripts to remove deprecated `--ext` flags for ESLint v9

**Outcome**: 
- Clean, scalable router architecture following React Router v7 best practices
- All tests passing (7 tests including route navigation, loading states, and structure validation)
- Improved developer experience with working `@/` imports
- Foundation ready for future route additions and features
- Modern tooling configuration aligned with current standards

**Files Modified**:
- `web/src/lib/router/router.tsx` - New modern router implementation with lazy loading
- `web/src/lib/router/router.test.tsx` - Comprehensive router tests
- `web/src/App.tsx` - Simplified to use RouterProvider
- `web/vite.config.ts` - Added path alias configuration
- `web/package.json` - Updated ESLint scripts
- `web/README.md` - Updated project structure documentation
