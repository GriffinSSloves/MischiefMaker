# Current Tasks

## CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE CHANGE - DCT Coefficient Steganography Required

### **Current Status: Pixel-Domain LSB Implementation Cannot Work**

The current implementation using pixel-domain LSB steganography is **fundamentally incompatible** with JPEG compression. The DCT/quantization process systematically destroys LSB relationships, making message recovery impossible even with triple redundancy.

**Mathematical Reality:**

- 100KB JPEG ‚Üí 3MB pixel data (30:1 compression)
- DCT quantization eliminates LSB relationships as "noise"
- No amount of redundancy can overcome systematic coefficient destruction

**Current Implementation Status:**

- ‚úÖ **275 tests passing** - All pixel-domain code works correctly
- ‚ùå **Fundamental design flaw** - Cannot survive JPEG compression
- üîÑ **Requires complete pivot** - DCT coefficient steganography needed

## JP3G FORK MODULARIZATION ‚úÖ **COMPLETED (2025-07-11)**

All legacy Huffman limitations have been resolved. The fork now produces fully spec-compliant JPEGs that parse in strict decoders, and every automated test (unit, integration, E2E, round-trip) passes.

**Current Status:**

‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Direct encode/decode tests pass  
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Coefficient modification tests pass  
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ E2E & round-trip tests pass  
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Strict decoder re-parse succeeds

**Technical Fixes Implemented:**

1. Standard baseline Huffman tables are written explicitly (DHT marker)
2. MCU output interleaves Y/Cb/Cr blocks with optional chroma up-sampling
3. Bit buffer alignment before EOI ensures clean termination
4. Quant-table fallbacks & validation added

No outstanding issues remain for the forked encoder.

## DEPRECATED: Pixel-Domain LSB Implementation

### **Current Core Foundation - DEPRECATED BUT COMPLETE**

The following implementation is **technically sound** but **fundamentally incompatible** with JPEG compression:

- ~~Complete steganography engine with 275 tests across utilities, algorithms, services, and integration (100% pass rate)~~ ‚ùå **DEPRECATED**
- ~~Production-ready SteganographyEngine with automatic method selection, fallback logic, and validation~~ ‚ùå **DEPRECATED**
- ~~Real encode-decode workflows with corruption recovery and cross-algorithm error handling~~ ‚ùå **DEPRECATED**
- ~~Production-ready algorithms with SimpleLSB (maximum capacity) and TripleRedundancy (error correction)~~ ‚ùå **DEPRECATED**

### **Preserve for Reference**

- **Keep existing code** as reference implementation
- **Archive pixel-domain tests** for educational purposes
- **Document lessons learned** from pixel-domain approach
- **Extract reusable utilities** (CRC32, header management, bit operations)

## FOUNDATION STATUS

### ‚úÖ **Completed Foundation (Still Valid)**

- **Modern monorepo setup** with pnpm workspaces
- **Zero TypeScript errors** across entire codebase
- **Modern development tooling** with ESLint flat config, Prettier, and pre-commit hooks
- **Type system atomization** - every type in its own file with direct imports
- **Platform-agnostic architecture** with dependency injection for image processing
- **Clean interface design** with clear, descriptive function names

### ‚úÖ **Completed Web Foundation (Still Valid)**

- **Modern React 19 setup** with TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS v4
- **ShadCN UI component library** fully integrated
- **React Router v7** with createBrowserRouter and lazy loading
- **Comprehensive testing setup** with Vitest and React Testing Library
- **Complete development tooling** with formatting, linting, and type checking

### ‚ùå **Deprecated Core Implementation**

- **Pixel-domain LSB algorithms** - SimpleLSBEncoder/Decoder, TripleRedundancyEncoder/Decoder
- **Pixel-based SteganographyEngine** - Cannot survive JPEG compression
- **275 pixel-domain tests** - Technically correct but fundamentally flawed approach
- **CanvasImageProcessor** - Current implementation assumes pixel-domain processing

---

## NEXT STEPS

### **Immediate Actions**

1. **Mark current implementation as deprecated** in code comments
2. **Research DCT coefficient libraries** for target platforms
3. **Create proof-of-concept** DCT coefficient modification
4. **Test basic JPEG coefficient stability** across quality levels
5. **Design new DCT-based interfaces** and architecture

### **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Keep existing utilities** - CRC32, header management, bit operations are reusable
2. **Replace image processing** - DCT coefficient manipulation instead of pixel-domain
3. **Maintain interface compatibility** - Same public API, different internal implementation
4. **Preserve test structure** - Replace pixel-domain tests with DCT coefficient tests
5. **Validate messaging compatibility** - Real-world testing with messaging services

### **Success Criteria**

- **DCT coefficient steganography** successfully embeds/extracts messages
- **Messaging service compatibility** - messages survive re-compression
- **Quality preservation** - visual changes remain imperceptible
- **Performance optimization** - production-ready speed and memory usage
- **Cross-platform support** - web, mobile, and Node.js implementations

## COMPLETED TASKS - DEPRECATED

See [completed.md](completed.md) for a full history of finished tasks. **Note**: Most completed tasks are now deprecated due to the architectural pivot to DCT coefficient steganography.

## ARCHITECTURAL DECISION SUMMARY

**Decision**: Pivot from pixel-domain LSB to DCT coefficient steganography

**Rationale**:

- Pixel-domain LSB fundamentally cannot survive JPEG compression
- DCT coefficients are preserved during JPEG-to-JPEG compression
- Messaging services use JPEG compression, requiring DCT coefficient approach
- No amount of redundancy can overcome systematic DCT quantization

**Impact**:

- Complete reimplementation of core steganography algorithms
- Platform-specific JPEG libraries required
- Existing utilities (CRC32, headers, bit operations) remain useful
- Web app and project structure remain unchanged
- Messaging service compatibility becomes achievable
