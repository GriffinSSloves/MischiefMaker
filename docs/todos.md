- ~~Choose steganography implementation approach~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - Selected combination strategy with automatic fallback (Simple LSB → Triple Redundancy)
- ~~Implement capacity calculation for both simple and triple redundancy modes~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - CapacityCalculator with 15 comprehensive tests
- ~~Implement CRC32 checksum validation for data integrity~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - ChecksumUtility with multiple algorithms and 36 tests
- ~~Build magic signature detection ("MSCH" identifier) and validation~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - HeaderUtility with complete header management and 36 tests
- ~~Build simple LSB embedding/extraction functions - 1 LSB per channel (primary method)~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - PixelDataUtility with comprehensive pixel manipulation and 39 tests
- ~~Build triple redundancy LSB embedding/extraction functions - 1 LSB per channel with 3x encoding (fallback)~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - PixelDataUtility with error correction support
- ~~Implement majority vote decoding for error correction in triple redundancy mode~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - BitOperations with voting algorithms and 32 tests
- ~~Create comprehensive test suite for combination strategy~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - 160 tests across 5 utility classes with full coverage

### High-Level Interface Implementation (Next Phase)

- **Implement IEncoder interfaces** (ISimpleLSBEncoder, ITripleRedundancyEncoder) - Build on existing utilities
- **Implement IDecoder interfaces** with automatic method detection and validation - Build on existing utilities
- **Implement ISteganographyEngine** with automatic method selection and fallback logic - Orchestrate all utilities
- **Create universal compression functions** (SMS/MMS quality level targeting - 45% quality)
- **Create image processing utilities** - JPEG compression, resizing, format conversion (platform-specific implementations)
- **Add encoding method detection** - identify which method was used during decoding
- **Create messaging service compatibility validation** - test both encoding methods with real scenarios

### Web Application Integration

- **Build the main steganography interface** (encode/decode messages) in web app
- **Implement file upload and image processing** with JPEG conversion
- **Add user-friendly error handling and validation**

## Web Development

_All basic web development tasks completed! Ready for steganography feature integration._

## Future Development

### Mobile Development

- Set up React Native development environment
- Implement mobile-specific UI components
- Integrate with core steganography library

### Future Algorithm Enhancements

- **Option B Implementation**: Direct JPEG coefficient manipulation (if reliability issues arise)
- **Reed-Solomon coding**: For extremely high reliability requirements
- **Adaptive LSB depth**: Automatic optimization based on image and message characteristics

## Foundation Status

### ✅ Completed Core Foundation

- **Complete utility foundation** with 160 tests across 5 utility classes
- **Type system atomization** - every type in its own file with direct imports
- **Platform-agnostic architecture** with dependency injection
- **Modern monorepo setup** with pnpm workspaces
- **Comprehensive test coverage** with co-located tests
- **Zero TypeScript errors** across entire codebase
- **Modern development tooling** with ESLint flat config, Prettier, and pre-commit hooks

### ✅ Completed Web Foundation

- **Modern React 19 setup** with TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS v4
- **ShadCN UI component library** fully integrated
- **React Router v7** with createBrowserRouter and lazy loading
- **Comprehensive testing setup** with Vitest and React Testing Library
- **Complete development tooling** with formatting, linting, and type checking
