# Steganography Implementation

## Overview

This document will contain technical specifications for the steganography implementation in MischiefMaker.

## Planned Features

- LSB (Least Significant Bit) manipulation for hiding data in images
- Support for PNG and JPEG formats
- Message size limits based on image resolution
- Cross-platform compatibility between web and mobile

## Implementation Details

*To be documented as the steganography engine is developed*

## Security Considerations

- End-to-end encryption before steganographic embedding
- Secure key generation and management
- No plaintext message storage
- Secure deletion of temporary data

## Performance Considerations

- Canvas API optimization for web platforms
- Memory management for large images
- Web Workers for CPU-intensive operations on web
- Native image processing libraries for mobile platforms
